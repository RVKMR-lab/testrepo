Good Morning/Good evening Sir/Madam,
I am the only source of income in my house. My sister is still studying. we are financially weak.
I am not in a position to pay the fee required to learn skills related to become a data scientist. I am doing a job for less salary. The amount i get as salary is to be used for the expenditure of my father's medicines, for my sisters education, to pay the rent of house, where we are living in right now.
My father is a diabetic and BP patient. He is not feeling well. I need to take care of him. I need to pay the fee for my sister's education and spend money for purchasing books and bus pass. As we are living in a rented house, most of my salary will be spent in paying its rent. My sisters marriage is also there that i need to finance. To do all these things I should get a better job.
I request you sincerely to provide me financial aid and kindly allow me to learn this course for free.
If I can become a data scientist, I will be able to get a good salary so that I can spend sufficient amount for my sisters education and marriage. I can take care of my fathers health and visit a good hospital and have proper food.
I cannot take loan and pay EMI for that because I am already paying debts made my father.Kindly understand my situation and provide me financial aid.
Thanking you Sir/Madam.
